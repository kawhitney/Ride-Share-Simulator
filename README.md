# CSCE4201_Project1
To gain a thorough understanding of the working of a simple, table-driven agent. This will enable you to put into practice the concepts of performance measurement, environment interaction, and the use of actuators (PEAS) to assist the agent’s navigation in a stochastic setting that mimics a real-world environment. Thus, this requires reading through the project specification carefully to make sure that you understand its requirements. Jot down any questions/doubts that you may have and feel free to ask me questions in class or in person. Together with your partner, work out a strategy before you start coding the solution in Python. Given the limited timeframe for the project, some simplifications have been assumed. In all cases, when simplifications are used, they have been pointed out explicitly. You may find it useful to compile: a) a list of all functional requirements and b) a list of all assumptions before starting to code.
